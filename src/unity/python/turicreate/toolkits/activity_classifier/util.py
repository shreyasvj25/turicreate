def random_split_by_session(dataset, session_id, fraction=0.9, seed=None):
    """
    Randomly split an SFrame into two SFrames based on the `session_id` such
    that one split contains data for a `fraction` of the sessions while the
    second split contains all data for the rest of the sessions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dataset : SFrame
        Dataset to split. It must contain a column of session ids.

    session_id : string, optional
        The name of the column in `dataset` that corresponds to the
        a unique identifier for each session.

    fraction : float, optional
        Fraction of the sessions to fetch for the first returned SFrame.  Must
        be between 0 and 1. Once the sessions are split, all data from a single
        session is in the same SFrame.

    seed : int, optional
        Seed for the random number generator used to split.

    Examples
    --------
